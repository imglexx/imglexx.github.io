"title":"How do I get cards ?",
"text":"Cards are most often collected through chests which can be won from events, found during Raids, or purchased with coins. When it comes to finding new Cards, the village you are in determines the cards you will receive from chests and their rarity as well. \n \nAnother great way to collect cards is by trading with friends. Normal Cards can be traded at any time with a limit of 5 per day, and Gold Cards can be traded during special events. \n \nLastly, the Viking Quest event also rewards you with a rare Gold card when completed.",

"text":"Card Trades themselves are set up by players over different platforms such as Facebook Messenger.\n\nTo send a card, open your card collections by pressing on the card icon found at the bottom right corner of the screen. Then, tap on the set containing the card you want to send. Tap on the card you wish to send and then on the Send button which will open up a list of friends. Please note that you can only send a card if you have more than 1, and Gold Cards can only be traded during special events.",
